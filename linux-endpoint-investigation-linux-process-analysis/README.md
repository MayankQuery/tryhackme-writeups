# Linux Process Analysis – TryHackMe

![Room Banner](https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/room-banners/advanced-endpoint-investigations.png)

## Overview
This repository contains my notes, commands, and findings from the TryHackMe room **Linux Process Analysis**, part of the *Advanced Endpoint Investigations* pathway.  
The room focuses on forensic investigation of **processes, cronjobs, services, autostart scripts, and application artefacts** in Linux systems.

- **Difficulty:** Easy  
- **Time to complete:** ~60 minutes  
- **Room Link:** [Linux Process Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxprocessanalysis)

## Learning Objectives
- Identify malicious Linux processes and persistence methods.  
- Analyze cronjobs for suspicious scheduled tasks.  
- Investigate rogue or malicious services.  
- Detect persistence in autostart scripts.  
- Explore application artefacts and logs for attacker activity.
