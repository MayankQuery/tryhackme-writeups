# Introduction to DevSecOps


**TryHackMe Room**: Introduction to DevSecOps


**Estimated Time:** 120 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner / Introductory
**Room Badge:** DevSecOps


## Overview


This room introduces the story of DevSecOps, software development models, and the concept of shifting left. You'll learn how development practices evolved, why security must be integrated early, and what a DevSecOps culture looks like.


## Learning Objectives


- Understand the history of software development practices and their evolution.
- Define DevSecOps and why it matters.
- Explain "shifting left" and how it reduces risk.
- Recognize DevSecOps culture as both technical and organizational practices.
- Get an overview of a DevSecOps learning path (pipelines, IaC, secrets, testing).


## Room Contents


The repository accompanies the TryHackMe room and contains:


- `NOTES.md` — concise study notes and explanations.
- `CHEATSHEET.md` — quick reference and commands.
- `tasks/` — task-by-task writeups and answers for each room task.


## Suggested Workflow


1. Read `NOTES.md` to get the foundational concepts.
2. Start the TryHackMe lab and follow each task. Use the files in `tasks/` to compare your answers.
3. Keep `CHEATSHEET.md` open while completing hands-on exercises.
