# Summary Notes: Training Impact on Teams

## Why Cybersecurity Training Matters
- Training builds skill, confidence, and readiness.
- Mistakes made in a safe training environment are valuable and risk-free.
- It’s better to be trained before an attack than to learn during one.

## Organisational Benefits

- Establishes a shared baseline of skills.
- Training outcomes can be measured and used for task assignments and promotions.

## Centralized Training
- Creates transparency in skill development.
