# Task 1 — What is Penetration Testing?


- Penetration testing (pentest) is a simulated, authorized attack against a system to find vulnerabilities.
- Purpose: reduce risk by finding weaknesses before malicious actors do.
- Pentests use the same tools and techniques as attackers, but follow rules of engagement and ethics.


**Key stat:** ~2,200 cyber attacks per day (industry estimates; cited in room content).

# Task 2 — Penetration Testing Ethics


- Always obtain written authorization before testing systems.
- Follow scope constraints, disclosure rules, and do not exfiltrate or destroy data.
- Maintain logs and document actions for reproducibility and accountability.

# Task 3 — Penetration Testing Methodologies


Common phases:
1. **Reconnaissance** — gather public information (OSINT).
2. **Scanning** — identify open ports, services, versions (Nmap, masscan).
3. **Enumeration** — deeper probing of services and accounts.
4. **Exploitation** — attempt to gain access (Metasploit, manual exploits).
5. **Post-exploitation** — escalate privileges, maintain access, gather evidence.
6. **Reporting** — document findings, risk ratings, remediation steps.


Tools: Nmap, Nikto, Gobuster, Dirb, Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark.

# Task 4 — Box Types: Black, White, Grey


- **Black box**: Tester has no prior knowledge — simulates external attacker.
- **White box**: Full access to source code, architecture — thorough auditing.
- **Grey box**: Partial knowledge — common for real-world engagements.


When to use each: black for external red-team style; white for code audits; grey for efficiency in time-boxed tests.

# Task 5 — Practical: ACME Penetration Test (Walkthrough)


> Note: this walkthrough is an example format — do the hands-on room yourself before copying answers.


1. **Setup**
- Deploy the VM from TryHackMe.
- Start a Kali Linux attacker VM and ensure networking (VPN/THM connection) is set.


2. **Recon**
- `nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap_initial.txt <target-ip>`
- Identify open ports and running services.


3. **Enumeration**
- If port 80/443 open, browse web site and run directory bruteforce:
- `gobuster dir -u http://<target-ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`
- Test login forms with common usernames; inspect source for comments.


4. **Exploitation**
- Use found credentials or exploit a vulnerable service. Example: upload functionality -> RCE via crafted payload.


5. **Post-exploitation**
- `sudo -l` to check sudo rights.
- Search for readable files with credentials: `grep -R "password" /var/www`.


6. **Conclusion & Reporting**
- Document steps, screenshots, root flags, remediation suggestions.
