# TryHackMe — Network Security Essentials

**Duration:** ~60 min

**Room progress:** 11% (example)

## Overview
In this room you learn core concepts of an enterprise network, the network perimeter, visibility (how we monitor), and how SOC analysts investigate suspicious activity using perimeter logs and network monitoring.

By the end of this room you should be able to:
- Describe the role of perimeter devices (firewalls, routers, IDS/IPS)
- Distinguish normal vs suspicious network traffic
- Use basic network capture/analysis tools (tcpdump, Wireshark, tshark)
- Query and interpret perimeter logs (firewall logs, syslog, proxy logs)
- Provide recommended mitigations for common perimeter attacks (scans, brute force, exposed services)

## Prerequisites
- Basic Linux command line comfort
- Familiarity with networking fundamentals (IP, TCP/UDP, ports)
- A TryHackMe account and active AttackBox or a Kali VM with networking tools installed

## Repo contents
This repo contains:
- `NOTES.md` — step-by-step notes keyed to each task
- `CHEATSHEET.md` — quick commands and log queries
- `TASKS.md` — the task checklist and hints

## How to use
1. Clone the repo into your lab workspace.
2. Use `NOTES.md` while you progress through each room task.
3. Keep `CHEATSHEET.md` open when performing captures or log analysis.
4. Use `TASKS.md` to mark progress and paste commands into your AttackBox terminal.
