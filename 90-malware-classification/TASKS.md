# Tasks & Suggested Answers — Malware Classification

> Paste these suggested answers into the TryHackMe task boxes (edit as you like).

## Task 1 — Introduction
**Q:** What is malware and why is classification important?  
**Suggested answer:**  
Malware is software designed to harm systems, steal data, or give unauthorized access. Classification helps SOC analysts choose the right response — e.g., isolate and recover for ransomware, hunt for persistence for trojans, or block C2 domains for botnets.

## Task 2 — Malware Types
**Q:** List and define common malware types.  
**Suggested answer:**  
- Virus: Attaches to files and spreads when executed.  
- Worm: Self-replicates across networks.  
- Trojan: Disguised as legitimate software to trick users.  
- Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment.  
- Spyware/Keylogger: Steals data and keystrokes.  
- Backdoor: Provides remote unauthorized access.  
- Rootkit: Hides presence and persists in the system.  
- Botnet: Network of compromised hosts controlled by C2.

## Task 3 — Real-World Malware Examples
**Q:** Give a short example of one real-world malware and its behavior.  
**Suggested answer:**  
A typical ransomware sample will enumerate user files, encrypt them using a generated key, delete backups (e.g., shadow copies), drop a ransom note, and attempt to communicate with a payment/C2 server for instructions. The presence of file-encrypting routines and ransom notes are strong classification indicators.

## Task 4 — Binary vs Script Malware
**Q:** How do you distinguish binary malware from script-based malware?  
**Suggested answer:**  
Binary malware is a compiled executable (PE/ELF) and often requires static tools like PE header analysis and dynamic sandboxing. Script malware is human-readable (PowerShell, Python, JS) and can be inspected directly; however, scripts are often obfuscated. Both can be classified by behavior: what they create, modify, or who they contact.

## Task 5 — Practical
**Q:** What steps would you take to classify an unknown sample safely?  
**Suggested answer:**  
1. Do not run on host — use isolated VM/sandbox.  
2. Compute hashes and record metadata (`md5sum`, `sha256sum`, `file`).  
3. Extract strings and search for indicators (domains, IPs, persistence keys).  
4. Run YARA rules and check sandbox behavioral report (if available).  
5. Execute in a controlled sandbox to observe filesystem, process, and network behavior. 6. Based on behavior (encryption, beaconing, credential theft) classify as ransomware, botnet, spyware, etc.  
7. Contain infected hosts and block IOCs (hashes/domains/IPs).

## Task 6 — Conclusion
**Q:** What are quick defensive recommendations based on classification?  
**Suggested answer:**  
- For ransomware: isolate, restore from backups, block C2, and check for lateral movement.  
- For botnets: block C2 domains/IPs, update IDS/IPS signatures, and remove persistence.  
- For spyware/keyloggers: remove malware, rotate credentials, and check for data exfiltration.  
- Share IOCs and update detection rules.

## Extra — Example Evidence Text
**Q:** If asked for evidence in the lab, use:  
**Suggested answer:**  
Static analysis found hardcoded domain `malicious.example.com` and suspicious persistence entries. Sandbox run produced periodic beacons to `malicious.example.com` and creation of `README_DECRYPT.txt` in user directories — consistent with C2 and ransom-note behavior.
