# TryHackMe SOC Level 2 – Incident Response: Identification & Scoping  

![TryHackMe Badge](https://tryhackme-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/MayankQuery.png)  

## Room Overview  
**Room Name:** Incident Response – Identification & Scoping  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Duration:** ~60 minutes  
**Category:** SOC Level 2 – Incident Response  

A deep dive into the **second phase** of the Incident Response Framework:  
**Identification & Scoping** – where analysts confirm security incidents, gather evidence, and determine the scope of compromise.  

---

## Learning Objectives  
In this room, I learned how to:  
- Identify the nature of security alerts.  
- Gather and interpret logs & evidence.  
- Leverage **Asset Inventory** & the **Spreadsheet of Doom (SoD)**.  
- Scope the extent of a compromise.  
- Understand the **feedback loop** between identification and scoping in IR.

## Target Machine Information  
- **VM Title:** Identification and Scoping Analyst VM  
- **Target IP:** `10.201.99.249`  
- **Time Limit:** 1 hour (extendable)  

---

## Tasks Completed  

### **Task 1 – Introduction**  
- Introduction to the **Spreadsheet of Doom (SoD)**.  
- Importance of Asset Inventory for quick correlation.  
- Context: A compromise was reported at **SwiftSpend Financial (SSF)**.  

---

### **Task 2 – Identification: Unearthing a Security Incident**  
- Reviewed **security alerts & logs**.  
- Identified indicators of compromise (IoCs).  
- Started populating **SoD** with suspicious IPs, domains, hashes.  

---

### **Task 3 – Scoping: Understanding the Extent**  
- Mapped affected systems against the **Asset Inventory**.  
- Assessed spread across users, hosts, and services.  
- Defined the **breadth & depth** of the incident.  

---

### **Task 4 – Identification & Scoping Feedback Loop**  
- Understood how evidence gathered in identification feeds scoping.  
- Applied an **intelligence-driven approach** to refine investigation.  

---

### **Task 5 – Conclusion**  
- Reinforced the need for **structured incident response**.  
- Highlighted how SoD + Asset Inventory accelerates detection & containment.  

---

## Key Takeaways  
- **Proactive IR requires preparation** – Asset Inventories must be up-to-date.  
- **Spreadsheet of Doom** is a practical, fast reference for analysts.  
- Identification & Scoping is not linear – it’s an **iterative feedback loop**.  
- Speed and accuracy at this phase directly impact **containment success**.
