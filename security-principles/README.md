## What I Learned

### 1. CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality** – keeping data private.
- **Integrity** – ensuring data accuracy.
- **Availability** – ensuring access when needed.

### 2. DAD Triad
- **Disclosure** – unintended access.
- **Alteration** – unauthorized changes.
- **Denial** – blocking access.

### 3. Security Models
- Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Clark-Wilson and their uses in data control and integrity.

### 4. Defence-in-Depth
- Layered security strategy to protect assets at multiple levels.

### 5. ISO/IEC 19249
- Common security design principles and system architectures.

### 6. Zero Trust Model
- “Never trust, always verify” model compared to traditional perimeter security.

### 7. Threat vs Risk
- Clear distinction and examples of how each affects an organization.

## 8. Threat vs Risk
- **Threat**: A potential cause of an unwanted incident (e.g., malware, hacker).
- **Risk**: The potential for loss/damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
- Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact

## 9. Conclusion
This room was an excellent introduction to foundational security principles. It reinforced how layered security, trust models, and a strong understanding of threats and risks are crucial in today’s digital landscape.
