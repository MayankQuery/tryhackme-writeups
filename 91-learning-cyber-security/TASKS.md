# Tasks & Suggested Answers — Learning Cyber Security

> Paste these suggested answers into the TryHackMe task boxes (edit as needed).

## Task 1 — Web Application Security
**Q:** Why is understanding how the web works important?  
**Suggested answer:**  
Because web applications are built from standard components (HTTP, forms, sessions). Knowing how these parts work helps you identify where inputs, authentication, or state management can be abused by attackers.

## Task 2 — BookFace (practical)
**Q:** What is the username of the BookFace account you will be taking over?  
**Suggested approach (non-spoiler):**  
Interact with the BookFace site, inspect requests and profile pages, and try the clues in the room. The username is discoverable within the application when you perform the steps in the challenge. (Do the lab steps to reveal the exact username.)

## Task 3 — Network Security
**Q:** Why is network knowledge useful for cybersecurity?  
**Suggested answer:**  
Network knowledge helps you understand how systems communicate, which ports/services are exposed, and how attackers find and move between targets. It supports both attack techniques (scanning) and defense (firewalls, IDS).

---

## Task 4 — Learning Roadmap
**Q:** What should you learn next after this room?  
**Suggested answer:**  
Follow a progression: Web fundamentals → OWASP Top 10 → hands-on web labs (BookFace, vulnerable apps) → specific exploit techniques (SQLi, XSS) → defensive topics (logging, IDS) and specialized paths (malware analysis, network pen-testing).

## Task 5 — Reflection / Conclusion
**Q:** How will this room help a new cybersecurity learner?  
**Suggested answer:**  
It sets a foundational mindset: how to inspect applications, think about attack surfaces, and prioritize safe, permissioned practice. It also points to next topics to study and labs to try.

## Extra — Evidence text (if required)
**Q:** If asked for evidence of completion, use:  
**Suggested answer:**  
Completed the BookFace challenge by following the lab steps, identified the target account via request inspection, and recorded the findings in the TryHackMe report.
