# History of Malware — Notes

## Intro — What is Malware?
- **Malware** = **malicious software**. Any software intentionally designed to cause harm, steal data, or disrupt systems.
- Early "malware" started as experiments and curiosity rather than profit-driven attacks.

---

## Task 2 — The Creeper Program
- **Name:** Creeper
- **Platform:** Early ARPANET / mainframes.
- **Behavior:** A self-replicating experimental program that displayed a message like "I'M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN".
- **Significance:** Often considered the first example of a self-replicating program (proto-virus/worm). It demonstrated propagation across networked systems.

---

## Task 3 — Reaper
- **Name:** Reaper
- **Platform:** Same environment as Creeper.
- **Behavior:** Written to remove Creeper instances; it tracked and deleted Creeper.
- **Significance:** Often cited as the first "anti-virus" — shows early defensive code responding to malicious/self-replicating programs.

---

## Task 4 — Wabbit
- **Name:** Wabbit (also called Rabbit)
- **Behavior:** Self-replicating program that creates many copies of itself to exhaust system resources (CPU, disk, memory).
- **Significance:** Demonstrates resource exhaustion as a damage vector rather than data theft or corruption.

---

## Task 5 — ANIMAL
- **Name:** ANIMAL (as referenced by the room)
- **Behavior / Notes:** ANIMAL appears in early malware histories as an example of early malicious programs — typically used to illustrate early payloads and simple destructive/annoying behaviors. (Room content lists ANIMAL as a named example to learn.)

---

## Task 6 — Elk Cloner
- **Name:** Elk Cloner
- **Platform:** Apple II floppies
- **Behavior:** Boot sector virus that spread via infected floppy disks and displayed a short poem every 50th boot.
- **Significance:** One of the first widely noted personal-computer viruses — showed that viruses could affect consumer machines via removable media.

---

## Task 7 — The Morris Internet Worm
- **Name:** Morris Worm
- **Platform:** Early Internet / Unix systems
- **Behavior:** Self-replicating worm exploiting vulnerabilities and default trust to spread, causing widespread disruption of systems.
- **Significance:** One of the first major Internet-scale worms; led to increased focus on computer security and the creation of incident response practices.

---

## Task 8 — Cascade
- **Name:** Cascade
- **Platform:** MS-DOS
- **Behavior:** A file-infecting virus known for causing the visual "falling characters" (cascade) effect on the screen; also corrupted executables.
- **Significance:** Example of DOS-era viruses that infected executables and provided visible, destructive payloads.

---

## Task 9 — Wrap-up / Feedback
- The room is a concise historical tour — great for understanding how motives and methods evolved.
- Takeaways: malware evolved from curiosity/experiments to criminalized & profit-oriented threats; early defenses (like Reaper) started as immediate responses by authors.

---

## Additional Notes
- Early malware often spread by physical media or trusted network services.
- The concept of a "worm" vs "virus": worm — network-propagating program; virus — requires host files / media to propagate (classic distinction for historical context).
- For writeups: keep descriptions short, cite the behavior and significance for each item.
