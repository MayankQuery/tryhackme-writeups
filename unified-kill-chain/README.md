# TryHackMe - Unified Kill Chain

This repository contains my personal notes, practical analysis, and summary of the TryHackMe room **Unified Kill Chain**, a critical concept in modern cyber defense frameworks. The room explores how attackers move through various stages of a cyber attack and how defenders can identify and mitigate risks using the Unified Kill Chain model.

## Room Overview
- **Platform**: TryHackMe
- **Room**: Unified Kill Chain
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time Taken**: ~40 minutes
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Kill Chain models in cybersecurity
  - Threat modeling fundamentals
  - Phases of the Unified Kill Chain:
    - Initial Foothold (In)
    - Network Propagation (Through)
    - Actions on Objectives (Out)
  - Comparison with Lockheed Martinâ€™s Cyber Kill Chain

## Why Unified Kill Chain?

This framework provides a more holistic view of attacker behavior by integrating both intrusion and post-exploitation phases. It helps defenders map adversarial activity comprehensively and proactively plug gaps in their security posture.
