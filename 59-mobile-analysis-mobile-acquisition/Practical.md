# Practical

# Lab Steps (Simulated)
1. Prep device & environment; record identifiers and state.
2. Choose acquisition technique (logical → filesystem → physical).
3. Acquire data; preserve original; store logs.
4. Hash outputs (SHA-256/MD5) and verify.
5. Minimal validation (open test parse) without modifying evidence.
