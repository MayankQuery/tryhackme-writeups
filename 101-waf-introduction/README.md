# TryHackMe – WAF: Introduction

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains structured notes and explanations from the TryHackMe room **"WAF: Introduction"**, which explores Web Application Firewalls, how they operate, how they detect threats, and their limitations.

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security system that monitors, filters, and blocks malicious HTTP/S traffic targeting web applications. This room focuses on WAF fundamentals, rule analysis, detection mechanisms, and common bypass techniques.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how firewalls evolved from simple packet filters to modern WAFs  
- Learn how WAFs detect attacks using **signature-based** and **behavioural** techniques  
- Identify WAFs using passive and active fingerprinting  
- Analyse WAF rules (especially OWASP Core Rule Set)  
- Recognise WAF limitations and bypass opportunities  

---

## 🧠 Key Topics Covered
- Network firewall vs. WAF differences  
- Deep dive into WAF detection logic  
- Signature rules: regex, patterns, threat signatures  
- Behavioural detection: anomaly scores, heuristics, thresholds  
- WAF fingerprinting (active & passive)  
- OWASP CRS rule structure  
- WAF misconfigurations  
- Attack scenarios & bypass examples

## 🏁 Conclusion
This TryHackMe room provides a solid foundation for understanding WAFs from both attacker and defender perspectives. It explains how WAFs work internally, why they fail, and how red teamers identify bypasses—while helping blue teamers understand how to tune rules for better security.
