## Quick Start

- Put your memory images (e.g., `.mem`, `.raw`, `.vmem`) **outside** of Git to avoid gigantic repos. This repo ignores them by default.
- Use `Notes/Volatility3_Cheatsheet.md` to quickly test hypotheses.
- Capture practical commands in `Practical/commands/` and summaries in `Findings/`.

## Author Notes

- Created for personal learning and portfolio documentation.
- Replace placeholders with your own screenshots, hashes, and findings.
