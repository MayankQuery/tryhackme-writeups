# Overview

Room: DFIR: An Introduction (TryHackMe)Difficulty: Easy — ~90 minutesDescription: Hands-on introduction to Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR), covering fundamental concepts, essential tools, and the PICERL process.

## Goals

Learn DFIR fundamentals and their practical applications.

Explore industry tools for evidence collection and analysis.

Document the process for portfolio and learning purposes.

## Tools Covered

Autopsy — Disk forensics and analysis.

KAPE — Triage data collection.

EZ Tools — Lightweight DFIR toolkit.

FTK Imager — Evidence imaging.

CLI utilities: strings, file, dd, fls, icat.

## Tasks Completed

Introduction — Understanding DFIR.

The Need for DFIR — Why it’s crucial in incident handling.

Basic Concepts — Chain of custody, evidence preservation, order of volatility.

DFIR Tools — Autopsy, KAPE, EZ Tools.

Incident Response Process — The PICERL framework.

Conclusion — Summary and forward path.

## Key Learnings

Maintain a chain of custody to ensure evidence integrity.

Follow the order of volatility when collecting data.

Use PICERL (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned) for structured incident response.

Tools like Autopsy, KAPE, and EZ Tools speed up investigations.
