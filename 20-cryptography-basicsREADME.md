# Cryptography Basics – TryHackMe

This repository documents my learning journey through the **Cryptography Basics** room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/cryptography).  
The module introduces the foundational concepts of cryptography, symmetric encryption, historical ciphers, and encryption mathematics.
