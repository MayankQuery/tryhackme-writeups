# TryHackMe – Cyber Kill Chain

This repository contains my personal notes and insights from completing the [Cyber Kill Chain](https://tryhackme.com/room/cyberkillchain) room on TryHackMe.

## Room Overview
The **Cyber Kill Chain** is a framework developed to understand and prevent cyber intrusions by analyzing the attack stages used by adversaries. This room breaks down each phase of the kill chain to help understand how to detect and defend against them.

## Room Completion Status
