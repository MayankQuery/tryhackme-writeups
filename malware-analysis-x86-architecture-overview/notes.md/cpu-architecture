# CPU Architecture (x86) — Notes

- **Fetch–Decode–Execute**: EIP → opcode/operands → ALU/FPU → update EIP/flags
- **Pipelines & Caches**: performance artifacts, rarely change semantics but can matter for timing checks/anti-debug.
- **Key Reverse-Engineering Signals**:
  - Indirect jumps/calls via registers (`call eax`) → dynamic dispatch, APIs, IAT
  - Self-modifying code writes to `.text` or RWX regions
  - Anti-debug: `int 3`, TEB/FS segment tricks, timing, `IsDebuggerPresent` (on Windows)
