## Prerequisites
- TryHackMe rooms: *MAL: Malware Introductory*, *Intro to Malware Analysis* (recommended)
- Basic Linux command-line familiarity
- A safe analysis environment (isolated VM or sandbox)
- Tools: `strings`, `file`, `md5sum`, `sha256sum`, `exiftool`, `radare2` or `Ghidra` for binaries; `python`/`node` runtime for scripts; Wireshark/tcpdump for network traces; optional YARA and Cuckoo/any sandbox

## Lab Setup
1. Start the TryHackMe target machine (if provided) or use an isolated analysis VM.
2. Place sample files in a working directory (do not run unknown samples on your host).
3. Use the `CHEATSHEET.md` for quick commands and detection snippets.
4. Copy suggested answers from `TASKS.md` into the TryHackMe answer boxes where needed.
