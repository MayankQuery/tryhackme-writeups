# Lab: Navigating the Defender XDR Portal

**Goal:** Familiarise yourself with the Defender XDR portal and perform specific checks (data connectors, RBAC, incidents view).

## Prerequisites

* Access to Microsoft 365 Defender portal (or follow along with screenshots if you do not have access).

## Steps

1. Open Microsoft 365 Defender portal: `https://security.microsoft.com`.
2. Sign in with a test account that has Security Reader access.
3. From the left menu, open **Microsoft Defender XDR** (or the section labelled XDR / Incidents).
4. Explore the **Overview** dashboard — capture `images/portal-overview.png`.
5. Navigate to **Settings → Roles & permissions**. Locate a built-in role and a custom role. Capture `images/rbac-diagram.png`.
6. Go to **Data connectors** and list which connectors are active. Note any missing connectors.
7. Open **Incidents** and filter by severity — take a screenshot of the incidents list.
8. If possible, open an incident and practice adding a comment, assigning an owner, and adding tags.

## Lab deliverables

* Add screenshots to `/images/` with descriptive filenames.
* Fill `tasks/tasks.md` with answers and attach the screenshot references.
