## Learning Objectives

- Understand the complete process that occurs when accessing a website.
- Revisit the roles of DNS, HTTP, and web servers in communication.
- Explore additional infrastructure components that improve website delivery and efficiency.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Domain Name System (DNS)
- Resolves human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
- Essential for locating the correct web server on the internet.

### 2. HTTP Protocol
- A communication protocol used to request data from and send data to web servers.
- Supports methods such as GET and POST.

### 3. Web Servers
- Handle HTTP requests and serve files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and videos.
- Common examples include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

### 4. Browser Rendering
- Once files are received, the browser renders and displays the website.

### 5. Additional Infrastructure Components
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**: Serve content from geographically distributed servers to reduce latency.
- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed resources locally or on proxy servers to reduce load times.
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent overloading.
