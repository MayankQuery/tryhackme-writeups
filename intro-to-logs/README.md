# TryHackMe — Intro to Logs (SOC Level 2)

This repository contains my notes, lab answers, and small scripts from the [Intro to Logs](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtologs) room on TryHackMe.

## Room Info
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Category:** SOC Level 2 — Log Analysis
- **Time Required:** ~30 minutes
- **Skills Covered:**
  - Understanding logs as historical activity records
  - Types, formats, and standards (Syslog, JSON, Windows Event Logs, CEF/LEEF)
  - Collection, management, and centralization methods
  - Storage, retention, and deletion practices
  - Basic log analysis techniques and tools

---

## Key Learnings
- Logs are a critical source for forensic investigations & threat detection.
- Standard log formats help unify data analysis across diverse systems.
- Centralized log collection is essential for efficient SOC workflows.
- Retention policies impact compliance, cost, and investigation capabilities.
- Even simple tools like `grep`, `awk`, and Python scripts can reveal patterns quickly.

---

## Hands-on Tools & Techniques
- **Command-line:** `grep`, `awk`, `sed`
- **Scripts:** Python log parser (for Syslog)
- **Concepts:** SIEM ingestion, agent-based collection (Wazuh, Osquery), cloud logging

---

## Next Steps
Following this module, I’ll be moving into:
- **Log Operations**
- **SIEM Investigations** (Splunk, ELK)
- **Endpoint Security** (Wazuh, Aurora EDR)
- **Intrusion Detection Systems** (Snort)
