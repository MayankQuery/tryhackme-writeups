# TryHackMe — MBR and GPT Analysis (Advanced Endpoint Investigations)

> Room: **MBR and GPT Analysis**  
> Difficulty: **Medium** • Est. time: **80 min**  
> Status: ✅ Completed (100%)

This repository documents my learning, methodology, notes, and answers for the TryHackMe room **“MBR and GPT Analysis”**.  
The room focuses on understanding disk partitioning schemes (MBR vs GPT), their roles in the boot process, and how attackers target them (bootkits, tampering). It also includes hands-on investigations for both MBR and GPT cases.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Explore the **boot process** (BIOS/UEFI → boot code → OS loader)
- Understand the **structure of MBR**
- Understand the **structure of GPT**
- Learn **attacks targeting MBR/GPT** (bootkits, tampering, persistence)
- Solve **practical investigation scenarios** (non-guided in Tasks 5 & 7)

---

## Lab Context
- **Target VM Title:** `MBR_GP_Analsisv0.2`  
- **Scope:** Disk/boot forensics, triage, and validation of MBR/GPT integrity

> Ethics: All actions are performed within the legal THM lab environment for educational purposes.

## Quick Start (Analyst Workflow)
1. **Acquire** the disk or first sectors (read-only):
   ```bash
   # MBR (first 512 bytes)
   sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=artifacts/mbr.bin bs=512 count=1

   # GPT headers + primary table (commonly first 34 sectors) and backup table (last 33)
   sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=artifacts/gpt_first_34.bin bs=512 count=34
   ```

2. List partitions using multiple tools:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdX
sudo parted -l
sudo sgdisk -p /dev/sdX
mmls /dev/sdX           # Sleuth Kit
```
