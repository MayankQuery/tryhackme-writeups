# TryHackMe – Cluster Hardening

This repository contains my structured documentation for the TryHackMe room **"Cluster Hardening"**, where I learned foundational DevSecOps practices for securing Kubernetes clusters.

## Room Overview
The room focuses on:
- Understanding cluster hardening concepts  
- Using CIS security benchmarks for Kubernetes  
- Securing Kubelet  
- Securing API traffic with TLS  
- Admission Controllers (mutating and validating)  
- Network Policies for restricting pod-to-pod traffic  
- Hands-on practical cluster security tasks  

## Key Topics Covered
- Kubernetes cluster architecture and attack surface  
- CIS Benchmarks and kube-bench usage  
- Kubelet configuration and authentication methods  
- TLS certificates for Kubernetes API components  
- Built-in and custom Admission Controllers  
- NetworkPolicy creation and enforcement
