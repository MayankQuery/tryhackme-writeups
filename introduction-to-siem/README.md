# Introduction to SIEM - TryHackMe Walkthrough

This repository documents my hands-on learning and key takeaways from the **Introduction to SIEM** room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/introductiontosiem), which is part of the Cyber Security 101 path. This room provides a beginner-friendly overview of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

---

## Room Overview

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** is a technology that aggregates, analyzes, and correlates logs and events from multiple sources to detect threats and support security operations.

---

## Topics Covered

- What is SIEM and how it works
- Importance of SIEM in modern security operations
- Network visibility through SIEM
- Log sources and log ingestion process
- Capabilities and use cases of SIEM
- Hands-on log analysis and alert interpretation

---

## Key Takeaways

- SIEM systems provide centralized log collection, real-time monitoring, threat detection, and compliance reporting.
- Effective SIEM implementation enhances incident response and network visibility.
- Common log sources include firewalls, endpoints, IDS/IPS, authentication systems, and servers.
- Proper parsing and correlation rules are critical for accurate alerting and reduced false positives.

---

## Lab Work

Screenshots and notes from practical exercises involving:

- Viewing and interpreting logs
- Simulated alert investigation
- Understanding correlation rules

All practical work was completed using the TryHackMe virtual lab environment.

## Learning Outcome

Completing this room strengthened my foundational knowledge of how SIEM systems operate in real-world environments, and their role in Security Operations Centers (SOCs).
