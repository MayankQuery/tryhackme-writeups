# TryHackMe - Detecting Web Attacks

ðŸ”— Room Link: [Detecting Web Attacks | TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/detectingwebattacks)

## Overview
This room covers detection of web attacks through **log analysis**, **network traffic analysis**, and **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**. It provides a mix of theoretical understanding and hands-on practice with tools like Wireshark and log analysis techniques.

### Objectives
- Learn common **client-side** and **server-side** attack types.
- Understand benefits and limitations of **log-based detection**.
- Explore **network trafficâ€“based detection**.
- Understand how and why **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)** are used.
- Practice detecting common web attacks in real scenarios.

### Prerequisites
- Familiarity with **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities.
- Completed:
  - [Intro to Log Analysis](https://tryhackme.com/room/intro2loganalysis)
  - [Wireshark: The Basics](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharkthebasics)
