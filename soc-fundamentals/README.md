## Overview
This repository documents my completion of the **SOC Fundamentals** room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), part of the **Cyber Security 101** learning path. The room focuses on the foundational aspects of a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** ‚Äî essential knowledge for any aspiring cybersecurity analyst.

## What I Learned

- **Introduction to SOCs**: Role, importance, and structure.
- **People**: Roles within a SOC (e.g., Tier 1/2/3 Analysts, SOC Manager, etc.).
- **Processes**: Incident response lifecycle, ticket handling, escalation paths.
- **Technology**: Overview of SIEMs, EDR, IDS/IPS tools.
- **Hands-on**: Practical alert triaging as a Level 1 SOC Analyst.

## Goal
To gain a solid understanding of SOC environments and processes, and prepare for real-world roles like **SOC Analyst (L1/L2)**.

*‚ÄúPeople. Process. Technology. These three pillars form the heart of every secure SOC.‚Äù*
