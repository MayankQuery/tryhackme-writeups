# Notes – Basic Pentesting

---

## 🔹 Enumeration Is Key

The room emphasizes the importance of enumeration before exploitation:
- Web directories
- Open ports and services
- User accounts

---

## 🔹 Web Application Testing

- Identified hidden directories using directory brute forcing
- Accessed development files containing sensitive information

---

## 🔹 Credential Attacks

- Used brute-force techniques to obtain valid credentials
- Extracted usernames and passwords from exposed services

---

## 🔹 Service Enumeration

- Identified SSH as the primary access service
- Logged into the system using discovered credentials

---

## 🔹 Linux Enumeration

- Enumerated users and system files
- Identified privilege escalation vectors

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

Basic enumeration and persistence often lead to full system compromise in poorly hardened environments.
