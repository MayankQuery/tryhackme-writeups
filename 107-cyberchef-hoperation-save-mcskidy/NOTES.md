## 🔹 Encoding vs Encryption

| Aspect | Encoding | Encryption |
|------|---------|------------|
| Purpose | Compatibility | Security |
| Confidentiality | No | Yes |
| Process | Standardized | Algorithm + Key |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Examples | Base64 | TLS |

- Encoding transforms data for usability and compatibility.
- Encryption protects data confidentiality.
