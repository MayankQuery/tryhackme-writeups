# L2 MAC Flooding & ARP Spoofing â€” TryHackMe


- **Room:** L2 MAC Flooding & ARP Spoofing
- **Duration:** 120 minutes
- **Skill level:** Intermediate (network fundamentals + basic Wireshark)


## What you'll learn
- How L2 switches build and use MAC tables
- MAC flooding to force switches into hub-like behaviour
- Passive sniffing vs sniffing during MAC flooding
- ARP cache poisoning (ARP spoofing) for MITM
- Sniffing and manipulating traffic with common tools (macof, arpspoof, bettercap, ettercap)


## Prerequisites
- Basic Linux skills
- Familiarity with OSI Layer 2 concepts and ARP
- Basic Wireshark usage
- A Kali/Parrot VM (or AttackBox) and the target machine(s) running in TryHackMe


## How to use this repo
1. Open the room in TryHackMe and start the machine(s).
2. Use `NOTES.md` as you progress through the room for commands and observations.
3. If you get stuck, `TASKS.md` contains short answers you can copy/paste.
4. Use `CHEATSHEET.md` for quick commands, Wireshark filters, and mitigation details.
