Burp Intruder tips

Use clusterbomb/username list in position, grep for distinct response strings.

Set a reasonable throttle and use a small list first.

Regex examples for parsing

Extract token from HTML: token=([A-Za-z0-9_-]{8,})

Check for email: ([a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,})

Remediation checklist (for defenders)

Return uniform error messages on login/password-reset.

Implement rate-limiting + lockout for repeated failed attempts.

Use cryptographically secure, single-use, time-limited tokens for resets.

Enforce strong password policies and MFA for sensitive accounts.
